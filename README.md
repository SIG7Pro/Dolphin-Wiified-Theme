# Wiified! An icon theme for Dolphin Emulator.

## What is Wiified?
Wiified is an icon theme for the Dolphin Emulator that aims to keep the user interface looking like it came out of a Wii itself! Built off of [Cleanexxed](https://github.com/Humanoidear/Cleanexxed/tree/main) by [Humanoidear](https://github.com/Humanoidear/Cleanexxed/tree/main).


## How to install: <br/>

This was taken from the original Cleanexxed project so I'm not entirely sure if this works on Windows and Linux.
(As my main device is an OSX machine, my Windows laptop is taken away, and my Linux laptop isn't powerful enough to handle stuff like this without it overheating.)
### (Windows)
Installation is simple, here's how it's done: <br/> 
- Download the code from here by clicking Code -> Download ZIP.
- Extract it using Windows Explorer or any software you got lying around.
- Locate the Cleanexxed/ Cleanexxed Lite folder (depending on which color theme you want to use).
- Navigate to the location that contains your Dolphin executable (dolphin.exe).
- Head over to Sys -> Themes and move the folder/s inside it. 
- For effects to take place, force restart Dolphin by closing it and reopening the executable file.

<br/>

### (Linux)
Installation is not as straightforward, but its still pretty simple, here's how it's done: <br/> 
- Download the code from here by clicking Code -> Download ZIP.
- Extract it using any compression software.
- Locate the Cleanexxed/ Cleanexxed Lite folder (depending on which color theme you want to use).
- Navigate to the following location: usr -> share -> games -> dolphin-emu.
- Head over to Sys -> Themes and move the folder/s inside it. 
- For effects to take place, force restart Dolphin by closing it and reopening the executable file.

### How to change the theme: <br/>
##### (Windows and Linux)
Just in case anyone doesn't know how to do it, here's how you can change the theme: <br/>
- Open Dolphin (duh.)
- Locate the "Options" tab on the menu bar (the one on the top) and click on it.
- Select "Configuration".
- On the new menu that just popped up, head over to the "Interface" tab and click the slider menu next to "Theme" (the bar).
- If everything on the previous guide was done correctly, you should be able to see your new theme/s there, now click it, and let your eyes enjoy the pleasure of a new theme for Dolphin ^^.

<br/>

### (MacOS)
(The MacOS version does not have the menu bar)
- Open Dolphin
- Locate the "Config" button on the top bar and click on it.
- On the new menu that just popped up, head over to the "Interface" tab and click the slider menu next to "Theme" (the bar).
- If everything on the previous guide was done correctly, you should be able to see your new theme/s there, now click it, and you'll have a brand-spanking new theme to gaze at for hours... or at least until you decide what to play ^^.
